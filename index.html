              The very first thing we need to do is to tell the HTML document
              that we have some CSS rules we want it to use. There are three
              different ways to apply CSS to an HTML document that you'll
              commonly come across, however, for now, we will look at the most
              usual and useful way of doing so — linking CSS from the head of
              your document.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a file in the same folder as your HTML document and save
                it as styles.css. The .css extension shows that this is a CSS
                file.
              </li>
              <li>
                To link styles.css to index.html add the following line
                somewhere inside the &lthead&gt; of the HTML document
              </li>
            </ul>
            <code
              >'hello'.charAt(0); // "h" <br />
              'hello, world'.replace('world', 'mars'); // "hello, mars" <br />
              'hello'.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO"</code
            >
            <p>
              This &ltlink /&gt element tells the browser that we have a
              stylesheet, using the rel attribute, and the location of that
              stylesheet as the value of the href attribute. You can test that
              the CSS works by adding a rule to styles.css. Using your code
              editor add the following to your CSS file
            </p>
            <code
              >const Pi = 3.14; // variable Pi is set <br />
              Pi = 1; // will throw an error because you cannot change a
              constant variable.</code
            >
            <p>
              Save your HTML and CSS files and reload the page in a web browser.
              The level one heading at the top of the document should now be
              red. If that happens, congratulations — you have successfully
              applied some CSS to an HTML document. If that doesn't happen,
              carefully check that you've typed everything correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can continue to work in styles.css locally, or you can use our
              interactive editor below to continue with this tutorial. The
              interactive editor acts as if the CSS in the first panel is linked
              to the HTML document, just as we have with our document above.

            <p>
              By making our heading red we have already demonstrated that we can
              target and style an HTML element. We do this by targeting an
              element selector — this is a selector that directly matches an
              HTML element name. To target all paragraphs in the document you
              would use the selector p. To turn all paragraphs green you would
              use:
            </p>
            <code>
              var name = 'kittens'; <br />
              if (name == 'puppies') { <br />
              name += ' woof'; <br />
              } else if (name == 'kittens') { <br />
              name += ' meow'; <br />
              } else { <br />
              name += '!'; <br />
              } name == 'kittens meow'; <br />
            </code>
            <ul>
              <li>
                You can target multiple selectors at once, by separating the
                selectors with a comma. If I want all paragraphs and all list
                items to be green my rule looks like this
              </li>
              <li>
                Try this out in the interactive editor below (edit the code
                boxes), or in your local CSS document
              </li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Changing_behavior">
          <header>Changing behavior</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as
              simple as our example, we can see how the browser is making the
              HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large
              and bold and our list has bullets. This happens because browsers
              have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they
              apply to all pages by default; without them all of the text would
              run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from
              scratch. All modern browsers display HTML content by default in
              pretty much the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, you will often want something other than the choice the
              browser has made. This can be done by choosing the HTML element
              that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it
              looks. A good example is our &ltul&gt, an unordered list. It has
              list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can
              remove them like so:
            </p>
            <code
              >while (true) { <br />
              // an infinite loop! <br />
              } <br />
              <br />
              var input; <br />
              do { <br />
              input = get_input(); <br />
              } while (inputIsNotValid(input));</code
            >
            <p>
              The list-style-type property is a good property to look at on MDN
              to see which values are supported. Take a look at the page for
              list-style-type and you will find an interactive example at the
              top of the page to try some different values in, then all
              allowable values are detailed further down the page.

              So far we have styled elements based on their HTML element names.
              This works as long as you want all of the elements of that type in
              your document to look the same. Most of the time that isn't the
              case and so you will need to find a way to select a subset of the
              elements without changing the others. The most common way to do
              this is to add a class to your HTML element and target that class.
            </p>
            <p>
              In your HTML document, add a class attribute to the second list
              item. Your list will now look like this:
            </p>
            <code
              >for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) { <br />
              // Will execute 5 times }</code
            >
            <p>
              In your CSS you can target the class of special by creating a
              selector that starts with a full stop character. Add the following
              to your CSS file:
            </p>
            <code
              >for (let value of array) { <br />
              // do something with value }</code
            >
            <p>
              You can apply the class of special to any element on your page
              that you want to have the same look as this list item. For
              example, you might want the &ltspan&gt in the paragraph to also be
              orange and bold. Try adding a class of special to it, then reload
              your page and see what happens.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sometimes you will see rules with a selector that lists the HTML
              element selector along with the class:
            </p>
            <code
              >for (let property in object) { <br />
              // do something with object property }</code
            >
            <p>
              As you can imagine, some classes might be applied to many elements
              and you don't want to have to keep editing your CSS every time
              something new needs to take on that style.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Therefore it is sometimes best to bypass the element and refer
                to the class
              </li>
              <li>
                unless you know that you want to create some special rules for
                one element alone
              </li>
              <li>
                perhaps want to make sure they are not applied to other things
              </li>
            </ul>

              There are times when you will want something to look different
              based on where it is in the document. There are a number of
              selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just
              a couple. In our document are two &ltem&gt elements — one inside a
              paragraph and the other inside a list item. To select only an
              &ltem&gt that is nested inside an &ltli&gt element I can use a
              selector called the descendant combinator, which takes the form of
              a space between two other selectors.
            </p>
            <code>
              switch (action) { <br />
              case 'draw': <br />
              drawIt(); <br />
              break; <br />
              case 'eat': <br />
              eatIt(); <br />
              break; <br />
              default: <br />
              doNothing(); <br />
              }
            </code>
            <p>
              Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when
              it comes directly after a heading at the same hierarchy level in
              the HTML. To do so place a + (an adjacent sibling combinator)
              between the selectors.
            </p>
            <p>
              The live example below includes the two rules above. Try adding a
              rule to make a span red, if it is inside a paragraph. You will
              know if you have it right as the span in the first paragraph will
              be red, but the one in the first list item will not change color.
            </p>

          <header>Styling things based on state</header>
          <article>
            <p>
              The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial
              is the ability to style things based on their state. A
              straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we
              style a link we need to target the &lta&gt (anchor) element. This
              has different states depending on whether it is unvisited,
              visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, or in the
              process of being clicked (activated). You can use CSS to target
              these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links pink
              and visited links green. a:link {
            </p>
            <code
              >switch (a) { <br />
              case 1: // fallthrough <br />
              case 2: <br />
              eatIt(); <br />
              break; <br />
              default: <br />
              doNothing(); }</code
            >
            <p>
              The default clause is optional. You can have expressions in both
              the switch part and the cases if you like; comparisons take place
              between the two using the === operator:
            </p>
            <code
              >switch (1 + 3) { <br />
              case 2 + 2: <br />
              yay(); <br />
              break; <br />
              default: <br />
              neverhappens(); }</code
